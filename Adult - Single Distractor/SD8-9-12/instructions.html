<h3> Instructions</h3>
<p class="blocktext"> In this task, you will be talking with Elmo about a series of cartoon pictures.  You can only send two words to Elmo at a time, but you must still try to convey what is happening in each scene.  </p> 
<br></br>

<p class="blocktext"> In each scene, Elmo will see the actors, but will run away and miss the action taking place.  When he returns, your job is to tell him what happened.  </p>
<br></br>

<p class="blocktext"> Again, you can use only two words to respond.  Your responses will be timed.  </p>
<br></br>


<p class="blocktext"><i> This is a QQQ SURVEY.  Please complete only one HIT from this group.  You will not be paid for completing more than one QQQ survey (including surveys taken in previous HIT groups.)</i> </p>
